  ### Hello, Iâ€™m Yogesh Jain <div class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</div>
  This personal blogsite is a collection of things I find interesting - from tech stuff that keeps me up at night to the goals in life that keep me inspired.

  I'm a `Staff SDE` at `EDB`, passionate about observability, open source and solving real-world problems. I specialize in Kubernetes, Observability, Distributed Systems, and CloudNative Postgres.
