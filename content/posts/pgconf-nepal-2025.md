### 🏔️🇳🇵 **PGConf Nepal 2025**

Visiting Nepal for the first time and getting an opportunity to speak at <a href="https://pgconf.org.np/" target="_blank">PGConf Nepal</a> 2025 was an unforgettable experience! The combination of warm hospitality, rich culture, scenic beauty, and a passionate tech community made this trip truly special.

The conference was hosted at **Kathmandu University**, located in the peaceful town of **Dhulikhel**. The campus, built on terrain and surrounded by the majestic **Himalayan ranges**, offered breathtaking panoramic views and perfect weather! Just walking around the campus felt refreshing and inspiring.

Beyond the conference, I also managed to briefly explore the vibrant city of **Kathmandu**. I visited the sacred **Pashupatinath Temple**, one of the ancient and sacred temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. The energy there was something I won’t forget. I also wandered through **Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square**, soaking in its ancient Newari architecture and vibrant street life. The blend of spirituality, history, and everyday hustle made the experience rich and memorable.

### 🎤 Talk Title - `Unified Observability: Monitoring Postgres Anywhere with OpenTelemetry`

At the conference, I had the opportunity to speak on a topic close to my heart i.e., `observability`. My talk focused on how we can achieve **Unified Observability** for Postgres — no matter where it runs: on the cloud, on Kubernetes, or on bare metal.

We discussed how **OpenTelemetry** helps collect consistent telemetry data like metrics and logs from different environments including <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/" target="_blank">CloudNative PG</a>, and how it integrates with open-source tools such as **Prometheus, Loki**, and **Grafana**. I also did a **live demo** showing how to monitor Postgres in a bare-metal & cloud-native setup, while keeping costs low and visibility high.

#### 🔥 Attendees learned:

- ✅ How OpenTelemetry brings consistent Postgres observability across cloud, Kubernetes, and bare metal
- ✅ How to collect telemetry data (metrics and logs) for effective Postgres monitoring
- ✅ How to leverage open-source tools (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana) to observe Postgres
- ✅ Tips to reduce observability costs while keeping full visibility
- ✅ Live demo of Postgres monitoring in cloud-native environments
