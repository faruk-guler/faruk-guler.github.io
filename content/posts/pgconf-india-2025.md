🚀 PGConf India 2025 was an incredible experience!

Nothing beats the energy of in-person interactions - deep technical insights, great conversations, and the joy of **reconnecting with old colleagues** while finally **meeting new ones** beyond the screen.

### 🔹 Learning & Innovation

From exploring **Postgres Internals** to discovering how companies are pushing boundaries - **running Postgres on Kubernetes, building GenAI applications with Postgres,** and more - it was a tech lover’s paradise! 🚀

### 🔹 Networking & Community

Had the privilege of meeting **legendary Postgres contributors** and reconnecting with colleagues. The best part? Engaging in live discussions at sessions, booths, and even over lunch! Nothing beats in-person interactions. 🤝

### 🔹 Key Takeaways

- ✅ Hands-on training on **building RAG applications** leveraging **pgVector** & optimizing vector searches
- ✅ Understanding **Throughput vs Recall** in vector search to balance cost vs performance
- ✅ Advanced **Postgres monitoring** with pgWatch 🔍

### 🎤 Housefull CloudNativePG Training!

One of the biggest highlights - my colleagues delivered a packed session on running Postgres on Kubernetes with CloudNativePG

### 🔥 Attendees learned:

- ✅ Spinning up HA Postgres clusters in Kubernetes 🏗️
- ✅ Monitoring, automated backups & PITR recovery 📊
- ✅ Scaling, switchovers & failovers for production-ready Postgres 💪
