<p><strong>"NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" </strong>refers to the user account with the highest privileges on the system in Windows NT and later versions. This account is used by the operating system to execute or manage a program or process. The "SYSTEM" account has a much higher level of permissions and authorities than regular user accounts. Access to this account is typically used for operations required at the administrator level.</p>

<li><strong>Has the highest privileges</strong>: <strong>SYSTEM</strong> is the account with the highest privileges on a system, including full access to the operating system's kernel mode. This includes the ability to perform operations such as making file and registry changes, starting and stopping services, and performing operations that are not permitted to other users. For example, some versions of SQL Server use the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account.</li>
